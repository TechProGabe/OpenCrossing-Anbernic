# Animal Crossing PC Port FORK FOR LINUX

A native PC port of Animal Crossing (GameCube) built on top of the [ac-decomp](https://github.com/ACreTeam/ac-decomp) decompilation project.

The game's original C code runs natively on x86, with a custom translation layer replacing the GameCube's GX graphics API with OpenGL 3.3.

This repository does not contain any game assets or assembly whatsoever. An existing copy of the game is required.

Supported versions: GAFE01_00: Rev 0 (USA)

## Quick Start (Pre-built Release)

Pre-built releases are available on the Releases page. No build tools required.

1. Download and extract the latest release zip
2. Place your disc image in the `rom/` folder
3. Run `AnimalCrossing`

The game reads all assets directly from the disc image at startup. No extraction or preprocessing step is needed.

## Building from Source

Only needed if you want to modify the code. Otherwise, use the releases above.

### Requirements
Just run the build_pc.sh , it will tell you the missing stuff but you just need to compile for x86 and also make sure you got SDL2 libs
## Controls

Keyboard bindings are customizable via `keybindings.ini` (next to the executable). Mouse buttons (Mouse1/Mouse2/Mouse3) can also be assigned.

### Keyboard (defaults)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| WASD | Move (left stick) |
| Arrow Keys | Camera (C-stick) |
| Space | A button |
| Left Shift | B button |
| Enter | Start |
| X | X button |
| Y | Y button |
| Q / E | L / R triggers |
| Z | Z trigger |
| I / J / K / L | D-pad (up/left/down/right) |

### Gamepad

SDL2 game controllers are supported with automatic hotplug detection. Button mapping follows the standard GameCube layout.

## Command Line Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | Enable diagnostic logging |
| `--no-framelimit` | Disable frame limiter (unlocked FPS) |
| `--model-viewer [index]` | Launch debug model viewer (structures, NPCs, fish) |
| `--time HOUR` | Override in-game hour (0-23) |

## Settings

Graphics settings are stored in `settings.ini` and can be edited manually or through the in-game options menu:

- Resolution (up to 4K)
- Fullscreen toggle
- VSync
- MSAA (anti-aliasing)
- Texture Loading/Caching (No need to enable if you aren't using a texture pack)

## Texture Packs

Custom textures can be placed in `texture_pack/`. Dolphin-compatible format (XXHash64, DDS).

I highly recommend the following texture pack from the talented artists of Animal Crossing community.

## Save Data

Save files are stored in `save/` using the standard GCI format, compatible with Dolphin emulator saves. Place a Dolphin GCI export in the save directory to import an existing save.

## Credits

This project would not be possible without the work of the [ACreTeam](https://github.com/ACreTeam) decompilation team. Their complete C decompilation of Animal Crossing is the foundation this port is built on.

## AI Notice

AI tools such as Claude were used in this project (PC port code only).
